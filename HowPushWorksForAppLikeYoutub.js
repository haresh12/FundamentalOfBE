I will ask you question just answer like him

How does push notification works in backend for application like youtub example if mr beats upload video and 100m people say receive notification then will youtub send notification to all 100m how this  scale works 



ChatGPT said:
Alright, here’s a Hussein Nasser–style answer:

When MrBeast uploads a video, YouTube doesn't immediately send 100 million notifications at once. That would melt the servers.

Instead:

Users are sharded — grouped across many servers and regions.

YouTube uses push notification services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification service (APNs).

It sends batched, asynchronous requests to those services.

Notifications are queued and rate-limited. They go out in waves, not all at once.

If a user is offline, the service stores the notification for a short time, depending on priority.

So yes, all 100M get it eventually, but the backend scales using shards, queues, retries, and external push infra. That's the secret.








You said:
need more deeper answer


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely. Let’s go deeper — Hussein Nasser style: low-level, scalable systems thinking.

🧠 Problem:
MrBeast uploads a video
→ YouTube needs to notify 100 million subscribers
→ But we can’t just blast 100 million push notifications all at once.
Why? Because:

Network throttling

Device push service limits (like FCM/APNs)

Backend overload

User timezone/device state differences

💡 Core Idea:
YouTube doesn’t push notifications directly.
It relies on cloud messaging brokers (like FCM) + its own fanout infrastructure.
Let’s break it down.

🔩 Step-by-step Backend Flow
1. Event Triggering System
When MrBeast clicks "Publish":

An internal Pub/Sub event is fired:
video_published_event(video_id: X, channel_id: MrBeast)

This goes to a distributed event pipeline (Kafka, Pub/Sub, etc.)

2. Fanout Service (Notification Service)
The video_published_event is picked up by a Notification Dispatcher Service.

This service:

Queries a subscriber index, like:
Get all user_ids where subscribed_to = MrBeast

This is stored in a partitioned, distributed database
(Think: Bigtable, Spanner, Cassandra — horizontally scalable)

But here’s the catch 👇
You can’t read all 100M subscribers at once — too slow, too expensive.

So what do you do?

3. Sharding Fanout
You shard the 100M users into groups:
Shard 1: Users 1–10M
Shard 2: Users 10M–20M
... up to Shard 10 or 100 depending on infra.

Each shard is:

Processed in parallel

Sent to background jobs (task queues like Celery, SQS, GCP Tasks)

Rate limited

Each shard job processes, say, 10,000 users at a time.

4. Push Gateway Queue (Buffering)
Now comes integration with push services (like Firebase or APNs):

YouTube doesn’t push directly to 100M devices.
Instead, it:

Builds the notification payload

Pushes into a rate-limited queue

That queue is consumed by Push Gateway Workers

5. Push Services
Each user device has a device token registered with FCM (Android) or APNs (iOS).

The workers:

Pull tokens from user profiles

Group them by push provider

Send batch notification requests to FCM/APNs.

6. Delivery and Retry
Push providers respond:

Success: Notification sent

Failure: Invalid token, rate limit, or device offline

YouTube’s system logs those and:

Retries with backoff

Deletes expired tokens

⚙️ Optimizations for Scale
Priority Queues: Active users might get notified first

Time-Zone Awareness: Some users are delayed

Notification Collapsing: If 3 videos are uploaded fast, only 1 notification sent

Rate-limiting per Region: Avoid network floods

AB Testing: Not all 100M may get the push (e.g., notifications sent to 80M based on engagement models)

🔐 Privacy & Control
YouTube also honors:

User settings (some opt-out of push, or only want email)

OS-level DND or battery optimization states

Personalized ranking: Not every sub is notified — depends on watch history, engagement, etc.

💥 Final Thought
So yes — MrBeast’s upload may reach 100M, but:

It’s asynchronous

Batched

Queued

Rate-limited

Done through cloud push infra

And personalized — not all 100M may get it

This is fanout-at-scale, and it’s beautiful.

Want diagrams or want to go even deeper into specific tech (like Kafka, queueing, retry strategies, etc)?








You said:
So when youtub uses services like APNS then in that case APNS IS RESPONSIBLE TO SEND PUSH ?


ChatGPT said:
🔥 Yes — exactly.

Once YouTube (or any app) sends the notification payload to APNs (Apple Push Notification Service), then:

✅ APNs Takes Over
YouTube’s backend is no longer responsible for delivering that notification to the iPhone.

Here’s how it works:

🧭 Step-by-Step:
YouTube backend prepares a push payload:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "aps": {
    "alert": {
      "title": "MrBeast just uploaded!",
      "body": "Watch it now before 100M views 🎥"
    },
    "sound": "default"
  },
  "videoId": "abc123"
}
It sends that payload to APNs, targeting the user’s device token.

http
Copy
Edit
POST https://api.push.apple.com/3/device/<device_token>
Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>
Once accepted, APNs is now responsible for:

Holding the push if the device is offline (for a few hours)

Delivering it as soon as possible (based on device state, battery, network, etc.)

🔄 So in short:
YouTube → APNs: "Here’s the message, here’s the token"

APNs → iPhone: "Deliver this when you can"

YouTube has no direct control over actual delivery time after this step.

🧠 Important Notes:
Delivery is not guaranteed. Apple may drop the message (e.g., device off too long, expired token).

Apple controls:

Notification priority

Delivery time window

Visibility when phone is locked, on Do Not Disturb, etc.

YouTube can track "sent", but not always "delivered" unless app opens and confirms receipt.

Let me know if you want to compare with FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) on Android side too.








You said:
now apns is backend stuff or its device specific stuff


ChatGPT said:
🔥 Great question — and it’s a subtle but very important distinction.

✅ APNs is backend infrastructure — managed by Apple.
It is not device-specific, even though it talks to devices.

🔧 What exactly is APNs?
It’s a cloud-based push notification service run by Apple.

It's a backend server that listens for notification requests from apps (like YouTube), and then delivers them to Apple devices (iPhones, iPads, etc.).

So the architecture looks like:
text
Copy
Edit
YouTube Backend ───▶ APNs (Apple Servers) ───▶ iPhone
                        ↑                       ↑
             (Runs in Apple's Cloud)       (Has device token)
📱 Device Role:
Each iOS device registers once with APNs and gets a device token.

That token is sent to the app’s backend (YouTube).

YouTube uses that token to address a push notification to the correct device — via APNs.

⚙️ In Summary:
Term	Layer	Who manages it
APNs	Backend Cloud	Apple
Device Token	Tied to Device	Generated by APNs
iPhone	Client/Device	User-owned
Notification	Payload	Sent by YouTube

💡 Key Insight:
APNs is like a post office.
YouTube sends the message to the post office (APNs), and Apple is responsible for delivering it to the right mailbox (iPhone), based on the device token.

Let me know if you want to dive into how device tokens are generated or expire, too.

/**
 * 🎯 Multiplexing / Demultiplexing – Real Technical Definition
Multiplexing: Technique where multiple logical streams (from different apps or sessions) share a single physical communication channel (like one TCP connection or one socket).

Demultiplexing: At the receiving end, the system uses identifiers (like port numbers, stream IDs, sequence numbers) to reconstruct and deliver each logical stream to its correct handler/process.

🧱 Where It's Used
Layer	Multiplexed What?	Example
Transport	Multiple app sockets → one NIC	TCP ports
Application	Multiple HTTP streams → one TCP conn	HTTP/2, HTTP/3
Network	Multiple IP datagrams → one physical link	IP over Ethernet
OS/Kernel	Multiple user processes → one kernel socket	epoll, select

🧪 System-Level Examples
🔹 TCP/IP (Transport Layer Multiplexing)
When multiple apps (e.g., Chrome tabs, VSCode, NPM) open TCP connections:

bash
Copy
Edit
# netstat or ss output
Proto  Local Address    Foreign Address  State       PID/Program
tcp    192.168.0.5:5040 172.217.161.46:443 ESTABLISHED  Chrome
tcp    192.168.0.5:5041 104.18.6.218:443   ESTABLISHED  VSCode
tcp    192.168.0.5:5042 13.224.10.125:443  ESTABLISHED  NPM
Your OS uses:

Source IP + Source Port

Destination IP + Destination Port

to multiplex and later demultiplex traffic over the same network card.

✅ The NIC sees one stream of packets
💡 The OS demuxes based on the 4-tuple

text
Copy
Edit
(source_ip, source_port, dest_ip, dest_port)
🔸 HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 Multiplexing
HTTP/1.1: 1 request per TCP connection

HTTP/2: Multiplexes many requests over a single TCP connection

HTTP/2 Headers:
Each stream has its own:

Stream-ID

Headers frame

Data frames

The server demuxes requests by stream ID, even though they’re interleaved at the TCP level.

🔥 This is why HTTP/2 solved the Head-of-Line blocking problem of HTTP/1.1.

🔸 QUIC / HTTP/3 Multiplexing (UDP-based)
Based on UDP (connectionless), but QUIC implements:

Stream IDs

Flow control

Encryption

It multiplexes multiple streams reliably over a single UDP connection, handling packet loss and reordering at user space.

This means:

YouTube can stream video (Stream ID 1)

Fetch comments (Stream ID 2)

Load ads (Stream ID 3)
→ all over one QUIC connection.

🔸 Kernel-Level Multiplexing: select, poll, epoll
When your server (say, Nginx or Node.js) handles thousands of sockets:

It uses epoll (Linux) or kqueue (BSD/macOS)

Registers multiple file descriptors

OS tells which one is ready

💡 You’re multiplexing multiple file descriptors into a single blocking call.

c
Copy
Edit
int epoll_fd = epoll_create1(0);
epoll_ctl(epoll_fd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, sockfd, &event);

while (1) {
  int n = epoll_wait(epoll_fd, events, MAX_EVENTS, -1);
  // demultiplex based on events[n].data.fd
}
🔁 Demultiplexing Techniques by Layer
Layer	Demux Field	Example
TCP	Port numbers	server:80, client:49152
HTTP/2	Stream-ID	0x00000001, 0x00000003
OS	File descriptor ID	fd = 3, fd = 4
QUIC	Stream-ID in packet	Managed in user space

💣 Final Takeaway
Multiplexing is a performance and scalability primitive.
Demultiplexing is how you avoid chaos at the receiving end.

Every efficient protocol, scalable backend server, and fast browser — depends on tight, predictable multiplexing and accurate demuxing.
